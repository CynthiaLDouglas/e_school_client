# Application Title: E-School LMS

As a forever educator, I left the classroom with the goal to bring back tech solutions that would promote access to technology to all students regardless of where, when and how they were born. Now more than ever we need solutions to keep our students learning and growing. E-School LMS will be the tech solution for virtual learning. A virtual one-stop shop, E-School LMS will provide a more organized, interactive space for students and educators to continue on as if they never left the classroom. This early version of the app allows users to create and register for courses. Users are authenticated and able to make changes to their user account. Course are available for view, updating and can be deleted. Registration is open! Students may register for courses using the course id and their student id number.

## Planning Story

I was very ambitious this time around. I found that there were many things that I had to continue to learn about Django, python, serializers... Ah! - You name it. Many of the things I encountered, I had to relearn the lot of it. I began a very large idea and scaled back thinking that I could potentially acheive developing a learning management system in four days. Initially, my user stories included multiple types of users and multiple resources. I quickly realized I had to use my time to get back to the basics. I spent a large amount of time on the backend working to develop a table that combined information from two existing tables. ForeignKeys were traded for serializers and models we built, deleted and rebuilt. Eventually, working on this idea of having a table that connected two others, I was able to CRUD on a resource that had values that existed in other places! On the front end, I tried my hand at some custom styling and more. This was an excellent learning experience and though I'm not there yet, I believe that experiences like these will help me grow as a developer in the long run.
